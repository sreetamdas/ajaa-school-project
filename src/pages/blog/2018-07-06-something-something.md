Didier Deschamps had no desire to answer a question on the eve of this game about whether France could end up as champions, a man who knows what it takes to win a World Cup stubbornly refusing to look too far into the distance. Deschamps, however, will only be able to avoid that subject for so long after France eased past Uruguay, courtesy of Raphaël Varane’s splendid header and an awful blunder by Fernando Muslera, to reach the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 2006.

Argentina and now Uruguay have been dispatched en route to the last four and, ominously for those teams left, it feels as though there is still so much more to come from France. What is clear is that the last thing they need is for anyone to give them a helping hand, but that is exactly what Uruguay did here.

Griezmann approached the ball, retreated and then stepped forward again before delivering an inswinging free-kick that seemed to catch Uruguay by surprise, perhaps because of the stutter in his run-up. Varane, timing his run perfectly, got across Cristhian Stuani to send a superb glancing header into the far corner.

It was a terrific header and, from the neutral’s point of view, exactly what this quarter-final needed. Up until that stage it had been a game of chess with France trying to make the more attacking moves. There was a surge of excitement inside the stadium whenever Kylian Mbappé was on the ball but the teenager was too fast for his teammates at times. One pass from Paul Pogba, beautifully slid on the inside of Diego Laxalt, encouraged Mbappé to dart in behind the left-back. Effortlessly going through the gear, Mbappé accepted the invitation and got to the byline to cut the ball back but the rest of the France attack were still catching their breath, trying and failing to keep up.
